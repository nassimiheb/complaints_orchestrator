# Refund Policy (EN)

Customers may request a refund when an item is defective, never delivered, or materially different from the order.

The support team should confirm order status, item condition evidence, and policy window before deciding.

If the defect is confirmed and the order is within policy window, refund is allowed.

If refund amount exceeds internal threshold, the case should be routed to human review before execution.

Customer communication must stay clear, polite, and solution focused.
