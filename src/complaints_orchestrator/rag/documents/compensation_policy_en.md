# Compensation Policy (EN)

Compensation is used when full refund is not required and a goodwill gesture is appropriate.

Voucher values should consider complaint severity, order value, and customer history over the last 90 days.

When repeated compensation behavior is detected, the system should lower automatic generosity and trigger human review.

Compensation offers must avoid exposing internal scoring or policy identifiers in customer messages.
